Run do_coordinate_matching() function in loc_match.py


Fines are indexed by Summon number (unique).
Road segments are indexed by physicalid and can be found in coordinates.txt in a form of:
"physicalid,coordinates"

During matching, the street names from the Centerline data are loaded from addresses.json in a pre-processed form.
